# Sippy React Frontend

Sippy's frontend is written in React and [Material-UI](https://v4.mui.com/). This project was
bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In development, you can start Sippy as usual, and then run `npm start`
in the sippy-ng directory.  You can also just run `make build`, and use
the UI as embedded in the Sippy binary. This is how it's run in
production.

When developing on the UI, it's better to run the API and UI separately
for quicker feedback (Sippy will listen on `:8080`, and when run with
`npm start`, the UI defaults to `:3000`)

You can browse to your local UI at http://localhost:3000/sippy-ng.

If you are just working on the UI, you can have the UI connect to the production Sippy API server.
To do this, change the [sippy-ng/.env.development](.env.development) file to contain:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL="https://sippy.dptools.openshift.org"
```

This also works as a runtime setting:

```
sippy/sippy-ng: $ REACT_APP_API_URL="https://sippy.dptools.openshift.org" npm start
```

If you are running tests and want to use the production Sippy API server, modify this line in [`setupTests.js`](src/setupTests.js):

```
process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL = 'http://localhost:8080'
```

to be:

```
process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL = 'https://sippy.dptools.openshift.org'
```
## Formatting requirements

Formatting requirements are enforced on the order of imports (alphabetically) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html).  The [prettier config](prettier.config.js) can be modified to change the formatting standards.  From the command line prettier formatting can be applied via
```
sippy/sippy-ng: $ npx prettier -w src/
```

For VScode, users install the [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) plugin; when the you see errors tagged with `prettier/prettier`, use the CMD/CTRL + Shift + P keys
followed by "Format Document" to quickly fix them.

Imports must be sorted alphabetically.  If using a multi-line import (also sorted alphabetically) then the first entry in that import determines the sort order relative to the other import statements.
```
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'
import { relativeTime, safeEncodeURIComponent } from '../helpers'
```
vs.
```
import { getReportStartDate, relativeTime, safeEncodeURIComponent } from '../helpers'
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'
```

Helpers for each of these can be configured for on save actions or 'sort-imports'

## Installing dependencies

```bash
cd sippy-ng
npm install
```

## Dependency vulnerabilities

To see if any of our NPM dependencies have an active CVE, run:

```
npm audit --production
```

This command is also run by `lint`, to make sure we don't ignore CVE's.

All audit commands should be given the flags `--production` or
`--omit=dev`. We only audit production, as that's what we deploy. See
[this GitHub issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/11174) for a
discussion about npm vulnerabilities and why we omit development deps.

In the ideal case, the only thing you'll need to run is

```
npm audit fix --production
```

Unfortunately it's somewhat common that you'll end up with challenges in
dependency management. `npm` will tell you the problematic packages,
like in the example below:

```
 cookie  <0.7.0
cookie accepts cookie name, path, and domain with out of bounds characters - https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pxg6-pf52-xh8x
fix available via `npm audit fix --force`
Will install react-cookie@1.0.5, which is a breaking change
node_modules/cookie
  universal-cookie  *
  Depends on vulnerable versions of cookie
  node_modules/react-cookie/node_modules/universal-cookie
    react-cookie  >=2.0.1
    Depends on vulnerable versions of universal-cookie
    node_modules/react-cookie
3 low severity vulnerabilities
To address all issues (including breaking changes), run:
  npm audit fix --force
```

This output is telling us:

- cookie less than 0.70 is vulernable to the linked CVE

- we have at least one package that won't let us upgrade to 0.7.x

- we can't fix it cleanly, but `--force` could by rolling back to react-cookie 1.0.5

You could try to force the fix with `npm audit fix --force --production`, and
review the results but it's usually not successful. In this case it
wasn't, downgrading from react-cookie 6.x to 1.0.5 is not the appropriate
way to go.  It's a red herring that it's trying to suggest such a path,
most likely because 1.0.5 has loose depenedencies. You should avoid
`--force`.

You can ask npm for more details about how we are requiring cookie:

```
$ npm why cookie
cookie@0.6.0
node_modules/cookie
  cookie@"^0.6.0" from universal-cookie@7.2.0
  node_modules/universal-cookie
    universal-cookie@"^7.0.0" from react-cookie@7.2.0
    node_modules/react-cookie
      react-cookie@"^7.2.0" from the root project
```

universal-cookie requires `^0.6.0`, but the fix for our CVE is in 0.7.0.
You can look at their source repo to see if they have an issue open for
the CVE. Likely, it's just a matter of waiting a few days for a fixed
release. If you figure out which package needs to get updated, you can
file an issue if there isn't one already to try to expedite the process.

If the particular problematic package isn't going to be fixed -- most
commonly because we're on an older version and changes won't be
backported, we need to update and deal with the breaking changes. In
this case universal-cookie 7.2.0 is the latest major release, so it
was just a matter of having them allow cookie 0.7.x.

## Testing

To run the tests run `npm test`.

For testing, we use [PollyJS](https://netflix.github.io/pollyjs) (to
record API responses) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

Components that contact the Sippy API should have at a mimimum:

   1. A test that matches against a snapshot
   2. Checks some canary text exists
   3. Verifies the number of API calls being made (to detect React useEffect loops)

Non-API components should verify minimal functionality and also
take a snapshot.

The API recordings and snapshots are stored in `__recordings__/` and
`__snapshots__/` directories, respectively. Commit them to the repository
if they change.

**If you are prompted to update any snapshots, ensure the changes are
expected.**

### Managing time

When snapshotting pages that use date or time, the test must mock out
Date.now() to ensure consistent snapshots.  You can use jest's spy
functions:

```javascript
  Date.now = jest
    .spyOn(Date, 'now')
    .mockImplementation(() => new Date(1628691480000))
```

### Updating snapshots

When changing any of the UI, snapshots will need to be retaken. Run `npm
test` and *review the diff* to make sure any changes are expected. If
they are, `npm test -u` and commit the results.

### Updating API recordings

The API recordings were taken against the 4.8GA historical data, and
unless there's a specific reason to use something else, start sippy as
follows:

```
./sippy --server --local-data ./historical-data/common --release 4.8 --start-day=-1
```

And then run:

```
POLLY_MODE=record npm test
``````

For some reason (not yet determined), updating Polly recordings and the
snapshots doesn't work in the same run. First re-record the API results
(you'll get snapshot errors), then run the snapshot update as above.

If you need to move on to something other than 4.8GA, please update this
section.

## Available Scripts
